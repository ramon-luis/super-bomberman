// GAME DESIGN NOTES

TODO LIST:
check if blast square == wall square, if YES -> no blast
update visuals: blasts, walls. background
add power-ups (larger blast, more bombs, new weapons)
add more weapons (kick, punch, detonate)
update sounds
correct orientation of mini-bomberman for lives
no blast collision if invincible
add more levels -> randomize elements of given level?
correct movement of Bomberman & Monster - don't allow overlap of walls
2-player mode
improve AI of monsters
add bomb-related music (Bombtrack, Super Bon Bon)

REFACTOR
blast to accept square instead of point


create grid of 143 (13 wide x 11 tall) squares -> add 1 each side for outer wall (14 x 12)
    fill each square as:
        open
        breakable
        wall

bomberman
    direction keys move bomberman one space in each direction
        if wall then does not move
        no orientation -> just move
    weapon key lays bomb
    has bomb power -> determines how far explosion travels
    can become "invincible" -> not hurt by explosion or monster


bomb
    http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588720-super-bomberman/faqs/13945
    you are under bomb at first - only conflict once you move
    need to move bomberman off square when bomb is laid
        check for space bar + direction key?
            if yes, then bomb gets placed in square in direction
            if no, then bomb gets placed in current square and bomberman moves in random direction?
                what to do if nowhere for bomberman to move?
            what happens when space bar released and direciton still pressed?
    alternate idea:
        first part - bomb flashes outline and characters can move through it
        second part - bomb flashes dark and characters cannot move through it


    bomb ticks -> then explodes
        cannot move past bomb - treat like wall
        explode travels in each direction
            draw flame with orientation and size?
        if explode collides with enemy, bomberman, or breakable -> then remove
        if explode collides with wall -> nothing
