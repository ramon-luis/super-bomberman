// GAME DESIGN NOTES

FROM CLASS:
create Scorable interface
score() - returns a LONG
add score() to movable
if Scorable, getScore from instance + score of movable
could add to gameboard based on level -> add score when level complete

use SVG make images better -> piazza
get imamge and convert to SVG OR draw PNG with paint


TODO LIST:
increase points for new level + bonus points for each life remaining
increase points based on type of enemy
make blasts grow -> starts at middle and then expands & contracts in size?
USE RADIUS INSTEAD OF SIZE FOR COLLISION -> monsters & bomberman, blasts & enemies, shocks & bomberman
update colors/flashing/action for hits to enemy
alternate colors for bomberman when protected (yellow, teal, white or any random?)

check all sounds
    new level sound
    change exit reveal
    change background music?

update win game:
    // draw text: Victory!  All enemies defeated!  All levels completed!  You are the superbomber!
    // draw bomberman flashing different colors


GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS:
add extra life
add kick as weapon
add invincible power up
add transport power up -> sends to random location
add bad power up -> bomb count == 0 temporary, play bad music

add fading -> fades quickly between different colors
squares made up of different shaded triangles to add texture?
create models that do not Collide for scenery -> stars, floorboards, etc?

change lives display to be icon + #
draw bomberman moving in different directions
add squares around key info: score, lives, bombs, power ups

REFACTOR
Clean up all code
Create LevelData as Objects? -> assign instance variables to get?

EXTRAS IF TIME
2-player mode or add boss
add bomb-related music (Bombtrack, Super Bon Bon)
bombs destroy power ups?
    have to check if blast that creates power up will also remove power up


DONE
update welcome screen
    // add each character to front
correct movement of Bomberman & Monster - don't allow overlap of walls
fix Bomberman shape
random move -> check if new direction is available.
make 3rd soldier - drone: randomly creates short blast
make alien change colors when hit
refactor Monsters - abstract class that inherits
monsters block each other
randomly assign exit
randomly assign power ups
add icon for bombs remaining
update invincible to start: remove fade & add flashing
correct orientation of mini-bomberman for lives
blast should explode bomb on collide
create larger blast power up
Exit only revealed when ALL ENEMIES GONE
update visuals: blasts, walls. background
check if blast square == wall square, if YES -> no blast





create grid of 143 (13 wide x 11 tall) squares -> add 1 each side for outer wall (14 x 12)
    fill each square as:
        open
        breakable
        wall

bomberman
    direction keys move bomberman one space in each direction
        if wall then does not move
        no orientation -> just move
    weapon key lays bomb
    has bomb power -> determines how far explosion travels
    can become "invincible" -> not hurt by explosion or soldier


bomb
    http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588720-super-bomberman/faqs/13945
    you are under bomb at first - only conflict once you move
    need to move bomberman off square when bomb is laid
        check for space bar + direction key?
            if yes, then bomb gets placed in square in direction
            if no, then bomb gets placed in current square and bomberman moves in random direction?
                what to do if nowhere for bomberman to move?
            what happens when space bar released and direciton still pressed?
    alternate idea:
        first part - bomb flashes outline and characters can move through it
        second part - bomb flashes dark and characters cannot move through it


    bomb ticks -> then explodes
        cannot move past bomb - treat like wall
        explode travels in each direction
            draw flame with orientation and size?
        if explode collides with enemy, bomberman, or breakable -> then remove
        if explode collides with wall -> nothing
